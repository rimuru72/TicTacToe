# TicTacToe

## About
This is a TicTacToe CLI Application I made for my midterms practical. Coded in java, this program is designed to have basic logic behind the popular TictacToe game. 

## Features
This CLI app asks for an input from two players. An input may only be numbers from 1 to 9 since the TicTacToe 3x3 board only has nine cells. Common errors will be taken care of such as input of letters.
